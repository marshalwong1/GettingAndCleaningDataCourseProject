Codebook - "GettingAndCleaningDataCourseProjectTidyData.txt"

This is the codebook for the tidyData.txt created by the 
run_analysis.R script.  tidyData.txt is a data set with the average of each
mean and standard deviation measurement for each subject and each activity
found in the UCI HAR Dataset.

There are 68 variables with the following definitions:

1 "Subject" - integer representing the subject of the movement
recorded.

2 "Activity" - a factor representing 6 activities performed by
the subjects:
  1 LAYING
  2 SITTING
  3 STANDING
  4 WALKING
  5 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
  6 WALKING_UPSTAIRS

The remaining variables 66 are described below:
